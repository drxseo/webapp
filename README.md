Enhancing Your Web App
This basic web app serves as a starting point. You can enhance it by:

Connecting to a database to store messages.
Implementing user authentication.
Using a front-end framework like React, Vue, or Angular for a more dynamic interface.
Expanding the back-end with additional RESTful API routes.
